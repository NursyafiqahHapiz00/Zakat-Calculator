# Zakat Calculator - PHP - 2021

## Overview

It is an honor for every developer to create a software that can asist users in their daily life. Therefore, I had created a Zakat Calculator application with the reference of project that been created by apurbo57 in **Github**. This application is used to calculate the amount of Zakat that need to be paid yearly and monthly by every eligible Muslims. The rate of Zakat that was being used in this application had been set according to the standard rate of Zakat in Malaysia which is 2.5%. 

There are a lot of programming languages that a developer can use, however, this application is more focuses on **PHP**. Therefore, I had use **PHP**, **HTML** and **CSS** in developing this application.  

First and foremost, I had created `index.php` file, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of Zakat Calculator instructions had been built in this file. **PHP** had been use to format the webpages as it is a powerful tool for making a dynamic and interactive webpages. 

However, **PHP** is quite limited in designing department. Hence, I had use **CSS** which is **Cascading Style Sheets** to add specific fonts, colours, and a few elements that can make the website looks more visual dynamic.

There are a few challenges that I entitle during developing this application and the one I would like to focus is on generating real time auto calculation by using PHP. I found it is difficult to generate it by using PHP and I discover it is more efficient to use JavaScript to implement it. Thus, I hope PHP can be used to generate this element in the future.
